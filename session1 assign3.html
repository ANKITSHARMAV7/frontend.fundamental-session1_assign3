		<h2>Mass–energy equivalence</h2>
		<p>In physics, mass–energy equivalence is a concept formulated by Albert Einstein that explains the relationship between mass and energy. 
		It states every mass has an energy equivalent and vice versa—expressed using the formula 
		<b>E = mc<sup>2</b></sup>
		where E is the energy of a physical system, m is the mass of the system, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum </p><br/>
		
		
		<h2>Dalton's gaseous law</h2>
		<p>In 1801, John Dalton published the Law of Partial Pressures from his work with ideal gas law relationship: 
		The pressure of a mixture of non reactive gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone. 
		Mathematically, this can be represented for n species as:
		<b>Pressure<sub>total</sub> = Pressure<sub>1</sub> + Pressure<sub>2</sub> + ... + Pressure<sub>n</sub></b></p>
